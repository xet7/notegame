.bb2 (Blitz Basic 2 tokenized)
=> Used AmiBlitz3 to save to .txt
=> .txt has these scandinavian characters, maybe replace sometime:

What is character set, when needing to convert ä to ä, Ä to Ä and ö to ö ?

Create a custom mapping file: Save the following content to a file named amiga_to_utf8.txt

0x1A 0xC3A4
0x1D 0xC384
0x1B 0xC3B6
0x1C 0xC396


iconv -f CUSTOM -t UTF-8 -c < inputfile.txt > outputfile.txt --byte-subst="<amiga_to_utf8.txt>"
