# TODO


- [_] Try to High Scored editor source code of binary `notegame/Aika/Tuloseditori.GTB.gtb`
- [_] What is at binary file `notegame/Aika/system-configuration` ?
- [_] What is file format of High Scores binary file at `notegame/Aika/Pelit/Aika-arvot.HISCORE` ?
  - Check part `load hiscores` and `savescores` from `notegame/Aika/Code/Aikaar_V0.26.txt`
- [_] Maybe try to make web version with HTML/CSS/JS/GIF/MP3. But maybe not all graphics, those are quite complex.
